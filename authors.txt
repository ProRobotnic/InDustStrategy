Project made by Fedor Shuvalov a.k.a. ProRobot/ProRobotnic/Frodo/WeirdGremlin
---
It's final version on ksavkin/project_game,
 because it's not project of ksavkin and it is unfair that he owns this repo.
New versions can be found on https://github.com/ProRobotnic/InDustStrategy

Ksavkin hasn't done much job, and all his code has been re-writen so many times,
 that it would be fair to say that I wrote all code by myself and all work
 was made by me only.
